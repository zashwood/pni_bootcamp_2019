    "# Dataset: Stroop Task\n",
    "In this exercise, we will practice using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statsmodels. To make the exercises more realistic, we will analyze behavioral data from a classic psychological experiment, the [Stroop task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). (These [previously published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25143543) data were made generously available by [Tim Verstynen](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000164/).)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, participants performed a variant of the Stroop task, in which participants are presented with words written in different color inks. There are three types of trials:\n",
    "1. Congruent trials (e.g. the word \"blue\" written in blue ink)\n",
    "2. Incognruent trials (e.g. the word \"red\" written in blue ink)\n",
    "3. Neutral trials: (e.g. the world \"car\" written in blue ink)\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants are instructed to name the font color of the word (not the word itself). This is easy for neutral and congruent trials, but more difficult for incongruent trials (e.g. when the word \"red\" is written in blue font, and the participant must respond \"blue\"). Classically, we observe an interference effect for incongruent trials such that participants' reaction times slow down and incorrect responses increase for incongruent trials. If you would like to try this for yourself, see [here](https://expfactory.github.io/stroop.html). In total, 28 participants each completed 120 trials of the Stroop task described above with trial types balanced (40 congruent, 40 incongruent, 40 neutral trials). Participansts were given 1s to make their response, recorded via keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a series of exercises, we will perform a basic analysis of the dataset and complete the following steps:\n",
    "* Aggregate and save a group dataset.\n",
    "* Rename and recorde variables.\n",
    "* Filter data to remove bad trials (e.g. missing trials, finger slips)\n",
    "* Visualize the cleaned dataset. \n",
    "* Perform basic statistical analysis of the data."

    "In our analysis later, we will be measuring the interference effect (i.e. the slowdown in reaction time with competing stimuli). To cleanly measure how much of a slowdown there is, we will want to remove trials with aberrant properties. That is, we want to remove trials whose attributes suggest that the participant's behavior was confounded on that trial. There are three properties we will look for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Incorrect trials:** incorrect trials are typically faster than correct trials. Can be caused by many factors (lapsed attention, rule-forgetting).\n",
    "2. **Fast trials:** trials with unrealistically fast reaction times (responding within 100ms). Typically caused by finger slips. \n",
    "3. **Slow trials:** trials with uncharacteristically slow reaction times (responding after 5s). Typically caused by lapsed attention.\n",

    "Though we will ultimately toss away incorrect trials, we do not want to do so blindly. One problematic scenario is if a subject has an accuracy of 50%.

In this scenario, we would want to toss away all of that subject's data, as they did not understand the task, and not only the trials they responded incorrectly to. In another problematic scenario (accuracy = 65%), we might throw away so many trials such that we have too few trials to reliably estimate an effect of interest. \n",
