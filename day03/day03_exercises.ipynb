    "# Day 3 Exercises (Pandas + Seaborn)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of exercises, you will perfrom part of the analysis from [Widge et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09557-4), *Deep brain stimulation of the internal capsule enhances human cognitive control and prefrontal cortex function*. In this paper, the authors found that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral striatum improved performance on a task of cognitive flexibility in a sample of 14 patients with severe depression. Specifically, response times on the task decreased (speeded up) with their DBS devices turned on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recreate some of the analyses and figures, you will use Pandas, Seaborn, and SciPy.stats. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "To probe cognitive flexibility, the authors employed a modified version of the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT). The MSIT requires subjects to identify which of a set of three numbers is different than its neighbors. Subjects must keep three fingers of their right hand positioned over response keys corresponding to the digits 1-3. In **Control** (non-interference) trials, the target is in the same spatial position as its corresponding response key, and the flanking digits are not valid responses (i.e., they are 0s). In **Interference trials**, the target is out-of-position relative to its corresponding key-press and is flanked by other viable targets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each block of trials contained 72 Control and 72 Interference trials. To prevent response sets or habituation, trial sequence in each block was pseudo-randomized so that subjects never had more than two trials in a row that shared the same interference level or desired response finger. This highly interleaved trial design was expected to place greater demands on cognitive control systems by reducing predictability of the stimuli. \n",
    "\n",
    "Patients performed this task twice: first with their DBS device turned **ON**, and then with their DBS device turned **OFF**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The file *dbs.csv* contains the raw behavioral data from the 14 patients. The data is organized into six columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Subject:* the unique subject identifier.\n",
    "- *Trial:* the trial number per block.\n",
    "- *DBS:* the status of the DBS device (ON = 1, OFF = 0)\n",
    "- *Interference:* the type of trial (Control = 0, Interference = 1)\n",
    "- *Accuracy:* the accuracy of the response of the trial (Correct = 1, Incorrect = 0)\n",
    "- *RT:* the response time on that trial (in seconds)."
