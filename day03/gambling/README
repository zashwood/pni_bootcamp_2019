Data Set Information
This dataset is comprised of the behavior gathered from 16 participants who completed a gambling task of an fMRI study. The dataset is split across 48 TSV files corresponding to the 3 runs of the task by each participant. The files contain varying numbers of observations (trials), contingent on run number, of 11 variables. Each file contains the following columns:
* onset:                      trial start time in seconds, relative to task
* duration:                   length of trial in seconds
* parametric loss:            see publication
* distance from indifference: see publication
* parametric gain:            see publication
* gain:                       potential gain for that trial
* loss:                       potential loss for that trial
* PTval:                      see publication
* respcat:                    participant response (1 = accept, 0 = reject, -1 = missing)
* response_time:              time to response of participant
