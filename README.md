# pni_bootcamp_2019
Lecture slides and tutorials for Princeton Neuroscience Institute's Graduate Student Math/Coding Bootcamp 2019

## Important notice: on Thursday 8/29, Ben Singer from PNI IT will give us a hands-on tutorial on using PNI's cluster resources from 1-2pm.  In order for you to be able to make full use of this tutorial, and to be able to practise running a small job on the cluster yourself, it is important that you register to get a PNI account before then.  Please contact pnihelp@princeton.edu, introduce yourself as a new PNI graduate student, and explain that you need to establish a PNI compute account.  If you have trouble getting set up with this, please let me know as soon as possible (zashwood@princeton.edu).
