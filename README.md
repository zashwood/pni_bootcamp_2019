# pni_bootcamp_2019
Lecture slides and tutorials for Princeton Neuroscience Institute's Graduate Student Math/Coding Bootcamp 2019

#### Important notice: please make sure you have a PNI compute account set up before Thursday 8/29.  

Ben Singer from PNI IT will give us a hands-on tutorial on using PNI's cluster resources from 1-2pm.  In order for you to be able to make full use of this tutorial, and to be able to practise running a small job on the cluster yourself, it is important that you register to get a PNI account before then.  You should have received an email about getting an account (check for an email from root@pni.princeton.edu).  If you did not receive this email, please go to https://pni.princeton.edu/ and click on "PNI Intranet (Internal)" at the very bottom of the page.  Then, log into the site with your PUID.  Click on the tab at the top entitled "Online Forms" and fill out the one entitled "PNI NetID".  Alternatively, please contact pnihelp@princeton.edu, introduce yourself as a new PNI graduate student, and explain that you need to establish a PNI compute account.  If you have trouble getting set up with this, please let me know as soon as possible (zashwood@princeton.edu).
