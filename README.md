## Notes
Students should register for PNI accounts prior to the bootcamp. This will facilitate tutorials on using the cluster. By the time of the bootcamp, students should have received an email about getting an account. If they did not receive, then they can follow the instructions below:

1. Go to https://pni.princeton.edu/
2. Click on "PNI Intranet (Internal)" at the very bottom of the page
3. Log into the site with your PUID
4. Click on the tab at the top entitled "Online Forms"
5. Fill out the form entitled "PNI NetID"

Alternatively, students can contact [pnihelp@princeton.edu](mailto:pnihelp@princeton.edu), introduce themselves as a new PNI graduate student, and explain that they need to establish a PNI compute account.
